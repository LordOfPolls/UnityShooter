# Oh hey!

### You found one of my projects for university... Guess i should just go over some stuff then

- Please don't copy this project, i really don't want to get done for plagiarism any time soon
- This project does not, in anyway, reflect my interests as a programmer, i do this because i have to
- This repo is only online and visible to act as version control for my projects and proof I've been working
- And last but not least... If you work for my uni **HI, GIVE ME A HONORS DEGREE PLS**
